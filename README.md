# static-binaries

Building scripts for useful static binaries :
 * dropbear (2020.81)
 * OpenSSL (1.1.1i)
 * nmap / ncat / nping (7.80)
 * socat (1.7.4.1)
 * tcpdump (4.99.0)
 * OpenSSH (8.4p1)

Actual supported architectures are : 
 * aarch64
 * mips (32 bits)
 * i686
 * x86_64

Other platforms may easily be added (cf. `arch.txt`)

## Usage 

The first script prepares the compilation environment (musl) and creates the
container. The build process is done inside an alpine container.

```shell
$ ./0_buildah.sh
```

The second script will cross compile libraries and binaries :

```shell
$ ./1_cross_compile.sh
```
All the binaries will appear in the output directory.

Compiled binaries are available in the release section, it only includes `bin`
and `sbin` folders. The tarball is generated by the last script :

```shell
$ ./2_generate_tarball.sh
```
